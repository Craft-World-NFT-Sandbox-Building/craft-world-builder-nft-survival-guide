## 🌍 What is Craft World?

Craft World is a voxel-style Web3 survival sandbox where players gather resources, craft tools, build structures, and defend against threats. Each crafted item or structure can be tokenized as an NFT, enabling real ownership and trading of in-game assets.

Explore biomes, fight enemies, unlock blueprints, and shape your own persistent world — solo or with friends.
